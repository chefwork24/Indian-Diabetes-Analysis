# Diabetes analysis



## Overview

This repository contains a classifier developed for the PIMA Indian Diabetes dataset. The goal is to detect the presence of diabetes using an ensemble-based approach, combining the strengths of LightGBM, XGBoost, and k-Nearest Neighbors.
## Implementation

LightGBM (lgboost): A gradient boosting framework known for its efficiency and speed.
XGBoost (xgboost): An optimized and scalable gradient boosting library.
k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): A simple yet effective instance-based learning algorithm.
## Ensemble Classifier

The classifiers are integrated into an ensemble classifier, leveraging their complementary strengths. The ensemble model improves overall performance and robustness, enhancing the accuracy of diabetes detection.
## Result

Achieved a cross-validation accuracy of around 76%
